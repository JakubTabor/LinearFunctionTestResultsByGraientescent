# It is important to test your data with (number of iterations and learning_rate) by changing number of iterations and number in learning_rate to get in the end number that You need
# this function [def predict_using_sklean():] retrun coef_ and intercept_
# [if math.isclose(cost, cost_previous, rel_tol = 1e-20):] it means that if my cost is in this range (1e-20) i stop my loop
# in this part (y_predicted = m_curr * x + b_curr) this is a pattern to calculate Y_predicted
